    API per l'applicazione WASAText che consente di chattare con le persone o gruppi di persone.
    Gli endpoint che agiscono sull'utente autenticato (es. setMyUserName, setMyPhoto)
    non richiedono un User ID nel percorso, poiché l'identificativo viene estratto
    dall'header di autorizzazione della richiesta.
